PandasAI is a Python library that adds Generative AI capabilities to [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), the popular data analysis and manipulation tool. It is designed to be used in conjunction with pandas, and is not a replacement for it.

## 📖 Documentation

The documentation for PandasAI can be found [here](https://pandas-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## 💻 Usage

> Disclaimer: GDP data was collected from [this source](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gross-domestic-product?tab=table), published by World Development Indicators - World Bank (2022.05.26) and collected at National accounts data - World Bank / OECD. It relates to the year of 2020. Happiness indexes were extracted from [the World Happiness Report](https://ftnnews.com/images/stories/documents/2020/WHR20.pdf). Another useful [link](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w19-world-happiness-report-2020).

PandasAI is designed to be used in conjunction with pandas. It makes pandas conversational, allowing you to ask questions to your data in natural language.

### Queries

For example, you can ask PandasAI to find all the rows in a DataFrame where the value of a column is greater than 5, and it will return a DataFrame containing only those rows:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandasai import PandasAI

# Sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "country": ["United States", "United Kingdom", "France", "Germany", "Italy", "Spain", "Canada", "Australia", "Japan", "China"],
    "gdp": [19294482071552, 2891615567872, 2411255037952, 3435817336832, 1745433788416, 1181205135360, 1607402389504, 1490967855104, 4380756541440, 14631844184064],
    "happiness_index": [6.94, 7.16, 6.66, 7.07, 6.38, 6.4, 7.23, 7.22, 5.87, 5.12]
})

# Instantiate a LLM
from pandasai.llm.openai import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(api_token="YOUR_API_TOKEN")

pandas_ai = PandasAI(llm)
pandas_ai(df, prompt='Which are the 5 happiest countries?')
```

The above code will return the following:

```
6            Canada
7         Australia
1    United Kingdom
3           Germany
0     United States
Name: country, dtype: object
```

Of course, you can also ask PandasAI to perform more complex queries. For example, you can ask PandasAI to find the sum of the GDPs of the 2 unhappiest countries:

```python
pandas_ai(df, prompt='What is the sum of the GDPs of the 2 unhappiest countries?')
```

The above code will return the following:

```
19012600725504
```

### Charts

You can also ask PandasAI to draw a graph:

```python
pandas_ai(
    df,
    "Plot the histogram of countries showing for each the gdp, using different colors for each bar",
)
```

![Chart](images/histogram-chart.png?raw=true)

You can save any charts generated by PandasAI by setting the `save_charts` parameter to `True` in the `PandasAI` constructor. For example, `PandasAI(llm, save_charts=True)`. Charts are saved in `./pandasai/exports/charts` .

### Multiple DataFrames

Additionally, you can also pass in multiple dataframes to PandasAI and ask questions relating them.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandasai import PandasAI

employees_data = {
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Name': ['John', 'Emma', 'Liam', 'Olivia', 'William'],
    'Department': ['HR', 'Sales', 'IT', 'Marketing', 'Finance']
}

salaries_data = {
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Salary': [5000, 6000, 4500, 7000, 5500]
}

employees_df = pd.DataFrame(employees_data)
salaries_df = pd.DataFrame(salaries_data)


llm = OpenAI()
pandas_ai = PandasAI(llm)
pandas_ai([employees_df, salaries_df], "Who gets paid the most?")
```

The above code will return the following:

```
Oh, Olivia gets paid the most.
```

You can find more examples in the [examples](examples) directory.

### ⚡️ Shortcuts

PandasAI also provides a number of shortcuts (beta) to make it easier to ask questions to your data. For example, you can ask PandasAI to `clean_data`, `impute_missing_values`, `generate_features`, `plot_histogram`, and many many more.

```python
# Clean data
pandas_ai.clean_data(df)

# Impute missing values
pandas_ai.impute_missing_values(df)

# Generate features
pandas_ai.generate_features(df)

# Plot histogram
pandas_ai.plot_histogram(df, column="gdp")
```

Learn more about the shortcuts [here](https://pandas-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shortcuts/).

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

In order to generate the Python code to run, we take the dataframe head, we randomize it (using random generation for sensitive data and shuffling for non-sensitive data) and send just the head.

Also, if you want to enforce further your privacy you can instantiate PandasAI with `enforce_privacy = True` which will not send the head (but just column names) to the LLM.

## ⚙️ Command-Line Tool

Pai is the command line tool designed to provide a convenient way to interact with PandasAI through a command line interface (CLI). In order to access the CLI tool, make sure to create a virtualenv for testing purpose and to install project dependencies in your local virtual environment using `pip` by running the following command:

Read more about how to use the CLI [here](https://pandas-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pai_cli/).
