PandasAI is a Python library that makes it easy to ask questions to your data in natural language. It helps you to explore, clean, and analyze your data using generative AI.

# üîß Getting started

The documentation for PandasAI to use it with specific LLMs, vector stores and connectors, can be found [here](https://pandas-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## üì¶ Installation

With pip:

```bash
pip install pandasai
```

With poetry:

```bash
poetry add pandasai
```

## üîç Demo

Try out PandasAI yourself in your browser:

# üöÄ Deploying PandasAI

PandasAI can be deployed in a variety of ways. You can easily use it in your Jupyter notebooks or streamlit apps, or you can deploy it as a REST API such as with FastAPI or Flask.

If you are interested in managed PandasAI Cloud or self-hosted Enterprise Offering, take a look at [our website](https://pandas-ai.com) or [book a meeting with us](https://zcal.co/gventuri/pandas-ai-demo).

## üíª Usage

### Ask questions

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from pandasai import SmartDataframe

# Sample DataFrame
sales_by_country = pd.DataFrame({
    "country": ["United States", "United Kingdom", "France", "Germany", "Italy", "Spain", "Canada", "Australia", "Japan", "China"],
    "sales": [5000, 3200, 2900, 4100, 2300, 2100, 2500, 2600, 4500, 7000]
})

# Get your FREE API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai.
# You can also configure it in your .env file.
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

agent = SmartDataframe(sales_by_country)
agent.chat('Which are the top 5 countries by sales?')
```

```
China, United States, Japan, Germany, Australia
```

---

Or you can ask more complex questions:

```python
agent.chat(
    "What is the total sales for the top 3 countries by sales?"
)
```

```
The total sales for the top 3 countries by sales is 16500.
```

### Visualize charts

You can also ask PandasAI to generate charts for you:

```python
agent.chat(
    "Plot the histogram of countries showing for each the gdp, using different colors for each bar",
)
```

![Chart](images/histogram-chart.png?raw=true)

### Multiple DataFrames

You can also pass in multiple dataframes to PandasAI and ask questions relating them.

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from pandasai import Agent

employees_data = {
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Name': ['John', 'Emma', 'Liam', 'Olivia', 'William'],
    'Department': ['HR', 'Sales', 'IT', 'Marketing', 'Finance']
}

salaries_data = {
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Salary': [5000, 6000, 4500, 7000, 5500]
}

employees_df = pd.DataFrame(employees_data)
salaries_df = pd.DataFrame(salaries_data)

# Get your FREE API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai.
# You can also configure it in your .env file.
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

agent = Agent([employees_df, salaries_df])
agent.chat("Who gets paid the most?")
```

```
Olivia gets paid the most.
```

You can find more examples in the [examples](examples) directory.

## üîí Privacy & Security

In order to generate the Python code to run, we take some random samples from the dataframe, we randomize it (using random generation for sensitive data and shuffling for non-sensitive data) and send just the randomized head to the LLM.

If you want to enforce further your privacy you can instantiate PandasAI with `enforce_privacy = True` which will not send the head (but just column names) to the LLM.

PandasAI is available under the MIT expat license, except for the `pandasai/ee` directory (which has it's [license here](https://github.com/Sinaptik-AI/pandas-ai/blob/master/pandasai/ee/LICENSE) if applicable.
