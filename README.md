PandaAI is a Python platform that makes it easy to ask questions to your data in natural language. It helps non-technical users to interact with their data in a more natural way, and it helps technical users to save time, and effort when working with data.

# üîß Getting started

You can find the full documentation for PandaAI [here](https://pandas-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can either decide to use PandaAI in your Jupyter notebooks, Streamlit apps, or use the client and server architecture from the repo.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Using the platform

The library can be used alongside our powerful data platform, making end-to-end conversational data analytics possible with as little as a few lines of code. 

Load your data, save them as a dataframe, and push them to the platform

```python
import pandasai as pai

pai.api_key.set("your-pai-api-key")

file = pai.read_csv("./filepath.csv")

dataset = pai.create(path="your-organization/dataset-name",
    df=file,
    name="dataset-name",
    description="dataset-description")

dataset.push()
```
Your team can now access and query this data using natural language through the platform.

## üìö Using the library

### Python Requirements

Python version `3.8+ <3.12`

### üì¶ Installation

You can install the PandaAI library using pip or poetry.

With pip:

```bash
pip install "pandasai>=3.0.0b2"
```

With poetry:

```bash
poetry add "pandasai>=3.0.0b2"
```

### üíª Usage

#### Ask questions

```python
import pandasai as pai

# Sample DataFrame
df = pai.DataFrame({
    "country": ["United States", "United Kingdom", "France", "Germany", "Italy", "Spain", "Canada", "Australia", "Japan", "China"],
    "revenue": [5000, 3200, 2900, 4100, 2300, 2100, 2500, 2600, 4500, 7000]
})

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://app.pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
pai.api_key.set("your-pai-api-key")

df.chat('Which are the top 5 countries by sales?')
```

```
China, United States, Japan, Germany, Australia
```

---

Or you can ask more complex questions:

```python
df.chat(
    "What is the total sales for the top 3 countries by sales?"
)
```

```
The total sales for the top 3 countries by sales is 16500.
```

#### Visualize charts

You can also ask PandaAI to generate charts for you:

```python
df.chat(
    "Plot the histogram of countries showing for each one the gd. Use different colors for each bar",
)
```

#### Multiple DataFrames

You can also pass in multiple dataframes to PandaAI and ask questions relating them.

```python
import pandasai as pai

employees_data = {
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Name': ['John', 'Emma', 'Liam', 'Olivia', 'William'],
    'Department': ['HR', 'Sales', 'IT', 'Marketing', 'Finance']
}

salaries_data = {
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Salary': [5000, 6000, 4500, 7000, 5500]
}

employees_df = pai.DataFrame(employees_data)
salaries_df = pai.DataFrame(salaries_data)

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://app.pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
pai.api_key.set("your-pai-api-key")

pai.chat("Who gets paid the most?", employees_df, salaries_df)
```

```
Olivia gets paid the most.
```
