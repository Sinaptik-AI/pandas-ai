You are provided with the following pandas DataFrames:

{dataframes}

<conversation>
{conversation}
</conversation>

This is the initial python code to be updated:
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
{default_import}

def analyze_data(dfs: list[{engine_df_name}]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart save it to an image in temp_chart.png and do not show the chart.)
    4. Output: return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "text", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Example output: {{ "type": "text", "value": "The average loan amount is $15,000." }}
    """
```

Using the provided dataframes (`dfs`), update the python code based on the last question in the conversation.
