Here are some examples of how to use PandasAI.
More [examples](https://github.com/Sinaptik-AI/pandas-ai/tree/main/examples) are included in the repository along with samples of data.

## Working with pandas dataframes

Using PandasAI with a Pandas DataFrame

```python
import os
from pandasai import SmartDataframe
import pandas as pd

# pandas dataframe
sales_by_country = pd.DataFrame({
    "country": ["United States", "United Kingdom", "France", "Germany", "Italy", "Spain", "Canada", "Australia", "Japan", "China"],
    "sales": [5000, 3200, 2900, 4100, 2300, 2100, 2500, 2600, 4500, 7000]
})


# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# convert to SmartDataframe
sdf = SmartDataframe(sales_by_country)

response = sdf.chat('Which are the top 5 countries by sales?')
print(response)
# Output: China, United States, Japan, Germany, Australia
```

## Working with CSVs

Example of using PandasAI with a CSV file

```python
import os
from pandasai import SmartDataframe

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# You can instantiate a SmartDataframe with a path to a CSV file
sdf = SmartDataframe("data/Loan payments data.csv")

response = sdf.chat("How many loans are from men and have been paid off?")
print(response)
# Output: 247 loans have been paid off by men.
```

## Working with Excel files

Example of using PandasAI with an Excel file. In order to use Excel files as a data source, you need to install the `pandasai[excel]` extra dependency.

```console
pip install pandasai[excel]
```

Then, you can use PandasAI with an Excel file as follows:

```python
import os
from pandasai import SmartDataframe

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# You can instantiate a SmartDataframe with a path to an Excel file
sdf = SmartDataframe("data/Loan payments data.xlsx")

response = sdf.chat("How many loans are from men and have been paid off?")
print(response)
# Output: 247 loans have been paid off by men.
```

## Working with Parquet files

Example of using PandasAI with a Parquet file

```python
import os
from pandasai import SmartDataframe

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# You can instantiate a SmartDataframe with a path to a Parquet file
sdf = SmartDataframe("data/Loan payments data.parquet")

response = sdf.chat("How many loans are from men and have been paid off?")
print(response)
# Output: 247 loans have been paid off by men.
```

## Working with Google Sheets

Example of using PandasAI with a Google Sheet. In order to use Google Sheets as a data source, you need to install the `pandasai[google-sheet]` extra dependency.

```console
pip install pandasai[google-sheet]
```

Then, you can use PandasAI with a Google Sheet as follows:

```python
import os
from pandasai import SmartDataframe

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# You can instantiate a SmartDataframe with a path to a Google Sheet
sdf = SmartDataframe("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/fake/edit#gid=0")
response = sdf.chat("How many loans are from men and have been paid off?")
print(response)
# Output: 247 loans have been paid off by men.
```

Remember that at the moment, you need to make sure that the Google Sheet is public.

## Working with Modin dataframes

Example of using PandasAI with a Modin DataFrame. In order to use Modin dataframes as a data source, you need to install the `pandasai[modin]` extra dependency.

```console
pip install pandasai[modin]
```

Then, you can use PandasAI with a Modin DataFrame as follows:

```python
import os
import pandasai
from pandasai import SmartDataframe
import modin.pandas as pd

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

sales_by_country = pd.DataFrame({
    "country": ["United States", "United Kingdom", "France", "Germany", "Italy", "Spain", "Canada", "Australia", "Japan", "China"],
    "sales": [5000, 3200, 2900, 4100, 2300, 2100, 2500, 2600, 4500, 7000]
})

pandasai.set_pd_engine("modin")
sdf = SmartDataframe(sales_by_country)
response = sdf.chat('Which are the top 5 countries by sales?')
print(response)
# Output: China, United States, Japan, Germany, Australia

# you can switch back to pandas using
# pandasai.set_pd_engine("pandas")
```

## Working with Polars dataframes

Example of using PandasAI with a Polars DataFrame (still in beta). In order to use Polars dataframes as a data source, you need to install the `pandasai[polars]` extra dependency.

```console
pip install pandasai[polars]
```

Then, you can use PandasAI with a Polars DataFrame as follows:

```python
import os
from pandasai import SmartDataframe
import polars as pl

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# You can instantiate a SmartDataframe with a Polars DataFrame
sales_by_country = pl.DataFrame({
    "country": ["United States", "United Kingdom", "France", "Germany", "Italy", "Spain", "Canada", "Australia", "Japan", "China"],
    "sales": [5000, 3200, 2900, 4100, 2300, 2100, 2500, 2600, 4500, 7000]
})

sdf = SmartDataframe(sales_by_country)
response = sdf.chat("How many loans are from men and have been paid off?")
print(response)
# Output: 247 loans have been paid off by men.
```

## Plotting

Example of using PandasAI to plot a chart from a Pandas DataFrame

```python
import os
from pandasai import SmartDataframe

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

sdf = SmartDataframe("data/Countries.csv")
response = sdf.chat(
    "Plot the histogram of countries showing for each the gpd, using different colors for each bar",
)
print(response)
# Output: check out images/histogram-chart.png
```

## Saving Plots with User Defined Path

You can pass a custom path to save the charts. The path must be a valid global path.
Below is the example to Save Charts with user defined location.

```python
import os
from pandasai import SmartDataframe

user_defined_path = os.getcwd()

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

sdf = SmartDataframe("data/Countries.csv", config={
    "save_charts": True,
    "save_charts_path": user_defined_path,
})
response = sdf.chat(
    "Plot the histogram of countries showing for each the gpd,"
    " using different colors for each bar",
)
print(response)
# Output: check out $pwd/exports/charts/{hashid}/chart.png
```

## Working with multiple dataframes (using the SmartDatalake)

Example of using PandasAI with multiple dataframes. In order to use multiple dataframes as a data source, you need to use a `SmartDatalake` instead of a `SmartDataframe`. You can instantiate a `SmartDatalake` as follows:

```python
import os
from pandasai import SmartDatalake
import pandas as pd

employees_data = {
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Name': ['John', 'Emma', 'Liam', 'Olivia', 'William'],
    'Department': ['HR', 'Sales', 'IT', 'Marketing', 'Finance']
}

salaries_data = {
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Salary': [5000, 6000, 4500, 7000, 5500]
}

employees_df = pd.DataFrame(employees_data)
salaries_df = pd.DataFrame(salaries_data)

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

lake = SmartDatalake([employees_df, salaries_df])
response = lake.chat("Who gets paid the most?")
print(response)
# Output: Olivia gets paid the most.
```

## Working with Agent

With the chat agent, you can engage in dynamic conversations where the agent retains context throughout the discussion. This enables you to have more interactive and meaningful exchanges.

**Key Features**

- **Context Retention:** The agent remembers the conversation history, allowing for seamless, context-aware interactions.

- **Clarification Questions:** You can use the `clarification_questions` method to request clarification on any aspect of the conversation. This helps ensure you fully understand the information provided.

- **Explanation:** The `explain` method is available to obtain detailed explanations of how the agent arrived at a particular solution or response. It offers transparency and insights into the agent's decision-making process.

Feel free to initiate conversations, seek clarifications, and explore explanations to enhance your interactions with the chat agent!

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from pandasai import Agent

employees_data = {
    "EmployeeID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Name": ["John", "Emma", "Liam", "Olivia", "William"],
    "Department": ["HR", "Sales", "IT", "Marketing", "Finance"],
}

salaries_data = {
    "EmployeeID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Salary": [5000, 6000, 4500, 7000, 5500],
}

employees_df = pd.DataFrame(employees_data)
salaries_df = pd.DataFrame(salaries_data)


# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

agent = Agent([employees_df, salaries_df], memory_size=10)

query = "Who gets paid the most?"

# Chat with the agent
response = agent.chat(query)
print(response)

# Get Clarification Questions
questions = agent.clarification_questions(query)

for question in questions:
    print(question)

# Explain how the chat response is generated
response = agent.explain()
print(response)
```

## Description for an Agent

When you instantiate an agent, you can provide a description of the agent. THis description will be used to describe the agent in the chat and to provide more context for the LLM about how to respond to queries.

Some examples of descriptions can be:

- You are a data analysis agent. Your main goal is to help non-technical users to analyze data
- Act as a data analyst. Every time I ask you a question, you should provide the code to visualize the answer using plotly

```python
import os
from pandasai import Agent

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

agent = Agent(
    "data.csv",
    description="You are a data analysis agent. Your main goal is to help non-technical users to analyze data",
)
```

## Add Skills to the Agent

You can add customs functions for the agent to use, allowing the agent to expand its capabilities. These custom functions can be seamlessly integrated with the agent's skills, enabling a wide range of user-defined operations.

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from pandasai import Agent
from pandasai.skills import skill


employees_data = {
    "EmployeeID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Name": ["John", "Emma", "Liam", "Olivia", "William"],
    "Department": ["HR", "Sales", "IT", "Marketing", "Finance"],
}

salaries_data = {
    "EmployeeID": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Salary": [5000, 6000, 4500, 7000, 5500],
}

employees_df = pd.DataFrame(employees_data)
salaries_df = pd.DataFrame(salaries_data)


@skill
def plot_salaries(merged_df: pd.DataFrame):
    """
    Displays the bar chart having name on x-axis and salaries on y-axis using streamlit
    """
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.bar(merged_df["Name"], merged_df["Salary"])
    plt.xlabel("Employee Name")
    plt.ylabel("Salary")
    plt.title("Employee Salaries")
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.savefig("temp_chart.png")
    plt.close()

# By default, unless you choose a different LLM, it will use BambooLLM.
# You can get your free API key signing up at https://pandabi.ai (you can also configure it in your .env file)
os.environ["PANDASAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

agent = Agent([employees_df, salaries_df], memory_size=10)
agent.add_skills(plot_salaries)

# Chat with the agent
response = agent.chat("Plot the employee salaries against names")
print(response)
```
