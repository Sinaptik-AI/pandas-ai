## Installation
You can install PandaAI using either `pip` or `poetry` (recommended). 
Python version `3.8+ <3.12` is required.
Before installation, we recommend you create a virtual environment using your preferred choice of environment manager (e.g: [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [Venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) etc.)

```console
# using poetry
poetry add pandasai

# using pip
pip install pandasai
```

## Chat with your data

In order to use PandasAI, you need a large language model (LLM). While you can use any LLM, for the purpose of this guide, we are using BambooLLM. 
You can get your free API key signing up at [pandabi.ai](https://pandabi.ai), which allows you to both use the data platform and get BambooLLM credits.

```python
import pandasai as pai

# replace "YOUR_PANDABI_API_KEY" with your API key from https://pandabi.ai
pai.api_key.set("YOUR_PANDABI_API_KEY")
```

### Chat with csv

```python
import pandasai as pai

# read csv - replace "filepath" with your file path
df = pai.read_csv("filepath")

# ask questions
df.chat('Which are the top 5 countries by sales?')
# replace "Which are the top 5 countries by sales?" with your question
```

### Save and load dataframes

To work faster with your data, you can save dataframes.
This allows you to avoid reading the data every time.

```python
import pandasai as pai

# read csv - replace "filepath" with your file path
df = pai.read_csv("filepath")

df.save(path="organization/dataset-name",
    name="dataset-name",
    description="describe your dataset")
```

The saved dataframe can then be loaded using the `load` method.

```python
import pandasai as pai

# read csv - replace "filepath" with your file path
df = pai.read_csv("filepath")

df.load("organization/dataset-name")
```


### Chat with multiple dataframes

PandaAI allows you to perform conversational data analysis on multiple datasets.

```python
import pandasai as pai

df_customers = pai.load("company/customers")
df_orders = pai.load("company/orders")
df_products = pai.load("company/products")

response = pai.chat('Who are our top 5 customers and what products do they buy most frequently?', df_customers, df_orders, df_products)
```
