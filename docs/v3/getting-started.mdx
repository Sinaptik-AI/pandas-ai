<Note title="Beta Notice">
PandaAI 3.0 is currently in beta. This documentation reflects the latest features and functionality, which may evolve before the final release.
</Note>

## Installation

PandaAI requires Python `3.8+ <3.12`. We recommend using Poetry for dependency management:

```bash
# Using poetry (recommended)
poetry add "pandasai>=3.0.0b2"

# Alternative: using pip
pip install "pandasai>=3.0.0b2"
```

## Quick setup

In order to use PandaAI, you need a large language model (LLM). While you can use any LLM, for the purpose of this guide, we are using BambooLLM. 
You can get your free API key signing up at [app.pandabi.ai](https://app.pandabi.ai), which allows you to both use the data platform and get BambooLLM credits.

First, import PandaAI and set up your API key:

```python
import pandasai as pai

# Get your API key from https://app.pandabi.ai
pai.api_key.set("YOUR_PANDABI_API_KEY")
```


## Chat with your data

```python
import pandasai as pai

# Load your data
df = pai.read_csv("data/companies.csv")

response = df.chat("What is the average revenue by region?")
print(response)
```

When you ask a question, PandaAI will use the LLM to generate the answer and output a response.
Depending on your question, it can return different kind of responses:
- string
- dataframe
- chart
- number

Find it more about output data formats [here](/v3/chat-and-output#available-output-formats).


## Creating your first data layer

### 1. Define a data source

Start by creating a data schema that describes your dataset:

```python
import pandasai as pai

# Load your data
df = pai.read_csv("data/companies.csv")

# Create the data layer
companies = pai.create(
  path="my-org/companies",
  df=df,
  description="Customer companies dataset"
)

```

This dataset will be saved in the `datasets/my-org/companies` folder of your project.

### 2. Define the structure of your dataset

By default, the column will be inferred from the data. For more control, though, you can define explicit column schemas:

```python
# Define a companies dataset with explicit schema
companies = pai.create(
  path="my-org/companies",
  df=df,
  description="Customer companies dataset",
  columns=[
    {
      "name": "company_name",
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The name of the company"
    },
    {
      "name": "revenue",
      "type": "float",
      "description": "The revenue of the company"
    },
    {
      "name": "region",
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The region of the company"
    }
  ]
)
```

### 3. Load and query data

Once defined, you can easily load and query your datasets:

```python
# Load existing datasets
stocks = pai.load("organization/coca_cola_stock")
companies = pai.load("organization/companies")

# Query using natural language
response= stocks.chat("What is the volatility of the Coca Cola stock?")
response = companies.chat("What is the average revenue by region?")

# Query using multiple datasets 
result = pai.chat("Compare the revenue between Coca Cola and Apple", stocks, companies)
```

## Sharing and collaboration

Share your data layers with your team:

```python
# Push datasets to the platform
stocks.push()
companies.push()
```

Team members can then access and query the shared datasets through:
- The web interface at [app.pandabi.ai](https://app.pandabi.ai)
- Their own PandaAI code using `pai.load("organization/dataset-name")`

Of course, they will only be able to see the datasets they have access to. You can control access using the [permission management](/v3/permission-management) features.
