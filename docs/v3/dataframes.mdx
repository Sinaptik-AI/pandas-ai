Once you have turned raw data into semantic enhanced dataframes with the [semantic layer](/v3/semantic-layer), you can load them as either materialized or virtualized dataframes, depending on the data source. 
Using the `.chat` method, you can ask questions and get responses and charts. 
These dataframes can be [shared with your team](/v3/share-dataframes) by pushing them to our [data platform](/v3/ai-dashboards).

## Materialized Dataframes

When working with local files (CSV, Parquet) or datasets based on such files, the dataframes are materialized, meaning:
- Data is loaded entirely into memory
- Fast access to all data
- Ideal for local file processing or cross-source analysis

```python
import pandasai as pai

# Load local files as materialized dataframes
file= pai.read_csv("local_file.csv")

df = pai.create(path="organization/dataset-name",
    name="dataset-name",
    df = file,
    description="describe your dataset")
```

## Virtualized Dataframes

When loading remote datasets, dataframes are virtualized by default, providing:
- Minimal memory usage through on-demand data loading
- Efficient handling of large datasets
- Optimal for remote data sources

```python
import pandasai as pai

# Load remote datasets (virtualized by default)
df = pai.load("organization/dataset-name")
