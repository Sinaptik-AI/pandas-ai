## Pushing Dataframes
Once you have turned raw data into dataframes using the [semantic layer](/v3/semantic-layer), you can push them to our data platform with one line of code.


```python
import pandasai as pai

df_customers = pai.load("company/heart-data")

df.push()
```
When you push a dataframe to the platform, business users and team mates can chat with your data using natural language.

## Pulling Dataframes

You can pull dataframes your team-mates have pushed to the platform by combining the load and pull methods.


```python

df_customers = pai.load("company/heart-data")
df_customers = pai.pull()
```
