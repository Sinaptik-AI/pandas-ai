PandaAI comes with a command-line interface (CLI) that helps you manage your datasets and authentication.

## Authentication

Before using PandaAI's remote features, you need to authenticate with your API key. Use the `login` command:

```bash
pai login PAI-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

This will:
1. Validate your API key format
2. Store it in your `.env` file
3. Preserve any other environment variables you might have

## Dataset Management

### Creating a Dataset

Create a new dataset through a guided process:

```bash
pai dataset create
```

You'll be prompted for:
- Dataset path (organization/dataset)
- Dataset name (optional)
- Description (optional)
- Source configuration (type, connection details, etc.)

### Pushing a Dataset

Push your local dataset to the remote server:

```bash
pai push organization/dataset
```

After pushing, you can access your dataset at: `https://app.pandabi.ai/datasets/organization/dataset`

### Pulling a Dataset

Pull a dataset from the remote server:

```bash
pai pull organization/dataset
```
