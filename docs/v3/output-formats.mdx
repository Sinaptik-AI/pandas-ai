description: 'Understanding the different output formats supported by PandaAI'
---

PandaAI supports multiple output formats for responses, each designed to handle different types of data and analysis results effectively. This document outlines the available output formats and their use cases.

## Available Output Formats

### DataFrame Response
Used when the result is a pandas DataFrame. This format preserves the tabular structure of your data and allows for further data manipulation.

### Chart Response
Handles visualization outputs, supporting various types of charts and plots generated during data analysis.

### String Response
Returns textual responses, explanations, and insights about your data in a readable format.

### Number Response
Specialized format for numerical outputs, typically used for calculations, statistics, and metrics.

### Error Response
Provides structured error information when something goes wrong during the analysis process.

## Usage

The response format is automatically determined based on the type of analysis performed and the nature of the output. You don't need to explicitly specify the format - PandaAI will choose the most appropriate one for your results.

Example:
```python
import pandasai as pai

df = pai.load("my-org/users")

response = df.chat("Who is the user with the highest age?") # Returns a String response
response = df.chat("How many users in total?") # Returns a Number response
response = df.chat("Show me the data") # Returns a DataFrame response
response = df.chat("Plot the distribution") # Returns a Chart response
```

## Response Types Details

Each response type is designed to handle specific use cases:

- **String Response**: Provides textual analysis and explanations
- **Number Response**: Returns numerical results from calculations
- **DataFrame Response**: Preserves the structure and functionality of pandas DataFrames
- **Chart Response**: Handles various visualization formats and plotting libraries
- **Error Response**: Structured error handling with informative messages

The response system is extensible and type-safe, ensuring that outputs are properly formatted and handled according to their specific requirements.

## Response Object Methods

The response object provides several useful methods and properties to interact with the results:

### Value Property
By default, when you print a response object, it automatically returns its `.value` property:

```python
response = df.chat("What is the average age?")
print(response)  # Automatically calls response.value
# Output: The average age is 34.5 years

# For charts, printing will display the visualization
chart_response = df.chat("Plot age distribution")
print(chart_response)  # Displays the chart
```

### Generated Code
You can inspect the code that was generated to produce the result:

```python
response = df.chat("Calculate the correlation between age and salary")
print(response.last_code_generated)
# Output: df['age'].corr(df['salary'])
```

### Saving Charts
For chart responses, you can save the visualization to a file:

```python
chart_response = df.chat("Create a scatter plot of age vs salary")
chart_response.save("scatter_plot.png")  # Saves the chart as PNG
```
