## What is PandaAI?

PandaAI is an open-source framework that brings together intelligent data processing and natural language analysis. Whether you're working with complex datasets or just starting your data journey, PandaAI provides the tools to define, process, and analyze your data efficiently. Through its powerful data preparation layer and intuitive natural language interface, you can transform raw data into actionable insights without writing complex code.

For users of previous versions, PandaAI 3.0 marks a significant evolution, expanding beyond conversational analysis to introduce a comprehensive data preparation framework that revolutionizes how you structure and interact with your data.

## Core Components

### Data preparation layer
The foundation of PandaAI 3.0 is its robust data preparation layer, which allows you to:
- Define semantic data schemas with rich metadata
- Establish data relationships across different tables
- Create integrated views combining multiple data sources
- Handle various data formats including Parquet, CSV, and more

### Natural language interface
Building on our established strengths, PandaAI continues to offer powerful natural language capabilities:
- Translate plain English queries into executable code
- Generate dynamic visualizations and charts
- Perform complex data analysis through simple conversations
- Create automated data insights

## Why choose PandaAI?

PandaAI 3.0 is designed for:
- Data Scientists seeking efficient ways to process and analyze data
- Data Engineers who need a flexible data preparation framework
- Analysts who want to combine the power of code with natural language interfaces
- Teams looking to standardize their data processing workflows

## Getting started

PandaAI offers two ways to leverage its capabilities:

### Open source library
The core PandaAI library is completely open source, giving you full control over your data processing and analysis workflows. Start with our [Semantic Layer Guide](/v3/semantic-layer) to learn about defining data schemas and creating integrated views.

### Data platform
For enhanced capabilities, connect your PandaAI implementation to our [Data Platform](/v3/ai-dashboards). This provides:
- Dataset-specific advanced conversational agents
- AI-generated dashboards
- Real-time DataFrame synchronization across multiple users
- Collaborative data exploration features
