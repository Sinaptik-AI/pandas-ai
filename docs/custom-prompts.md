# Custom prompts

In some cases, you may want to customize the prompts that are used by PandasAI. For example, you may want to use a different prompt for a specific use case to improve the results for certain types of queries.

With PandasAI, you can easily customize the prompts that are used by the library. You can do this by passing a `prompts` dictionary to the `PandasAI` constructor. The keys of the dictionary are the names of the prompts, and the values are the prompts themselves.

There are 5 types of prompts that you can override at the moment:

- `generate_python_code`: this is the prompt that is used to generate Python code from a natural language query. PandasAI uses this prompt as the standard prompt for the first query.

- `correct_error`: this is the prompt that is used to correct the generated Python code. Whenever the code generated by PandasAI is not correct, an exception is raised and a new call to the LLM is made with this prompt to correct the error.

- `multiple_dataframes`: this is the prompt that is used when multiple dataframes are passed to PandasAI. PandasAI uses this prompt as the standard prompt for the first query with multiple dataframes.

- `correct_multiple_dataframes_error`: this is the prompt that is used to correct the generated Python code when multiple dataframes are passed to PandasAI. Whenever the code generated by PandasAI is not correct, an exception is raised and a new call to the LLM is made with this prompt to correct the error.

- `generate_response`: this is the prompt that is used to generate the natural language response based on the result of the generated Python code.
