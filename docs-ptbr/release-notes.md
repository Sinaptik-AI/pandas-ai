# Release Process
At the moment, the release process is manual. We try to make frequent releases. Usually, we release a new version 
when we have a new feature or bugfix. A developer with admin rights to the repository will create a new release on 
GitHub, and then publish the new version to PyPI.

## Project Documentation

The release of project documentation is also a manual process and hosted on `readthedocs` server.
